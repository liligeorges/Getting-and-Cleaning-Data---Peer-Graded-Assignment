Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Criteria:

1. Submit a tidy dataset.
2. Submit Github repo with required scripts.
3. Repo contains an updated codebook with relevant detail on variables, summaries, units and other pertinent information.
4. Include an understandable README file that describes the performed analysis.
5. Submission is original work.

Retrieved and modified from the course (John Hopkins "Getting and Cleaning Data") final project instructions: 

Collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The data for the project involves wearable computing:

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
